This tool\naims to generate clients which:\n\n1. Use all the latest and greatest Python features like type annotations and dataclasses\n1. Don\'t carry around a bunch of compatibility code for older version of Python (e.g. the `six` package)\n1. Have better documentation and more obvious usage instructions\n\nAdditionally, because this generator is written in Python, it should be more accessible to contribution by the people\nusing it (Python developers).\n\n## Installation\n\nI recommend you install with [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) so you don\'t conflict with any other packages\nyou might have: `pipx install openapi-python-client`.\n\nBetter yet, use `pipx run openapi-python-client <normal params / options>` to always use the latest version of the generator.\n\nYou can install with normal pip if you want to though: `pip install openapi-python-client`\n\nThen, if you want tab completion: `openapi-python-client --install-completion`\n\n## Usage\n\n### Create a new client\n\n`openapi-python-client generate --url https://my.api.com/openapi.json`\n\nThis will generate a new client library named based on the title in your OpenAPI spec. For example, if the title\nof your API is "My API", the expected output will be "my-api-client". If a folder already exists by that name, you\'ll\nget an error.\n\n### Update an existing client\n\n`openapi-python-client update --url https://my.api.com/openapi.json`\n\n> For more usage details run `openapi-python-client --help` or read [usage](usage.md)\n\n## What You Get\n\n1. A `pyproject.toml` file with some basic metadata intended to be used with [Poetry].\n1. A `README.md` you\'ll most definitely need to update with your project\'s details\n1. A Python module named just like the auto-generated project name (e.g. "my_api_client") which contains:\n   1. A `client` module which will have both a `Client` class and an `AuthenticatedClient` class. You\'ll need these\n      for calling the functions in the `api` module.\n   1. An `api` module which will contain one module for each tag in your OpenAPI spec, as well as a `default` module\n      for endpoints without a tag. Each of these modules in turn contains one function for calling each endpoint.\n   1. A `models` module which has all the classes defined by the various schemas in your OpenAPI spec\n\nFor a full example you can look at the `test_end_to_end` directory which has a declared [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)\nserver and the resulting openapi.json file in the "fastapi" directory. "golden-record" is the generated client from that\nOpenAPI document.\n\n## OpenAPI features supported\n\n1. All HTTP Methods\n1. JSON and form bodies, path and query parameters\n1. File uploads with multipart/form-data bodies\n1. float, string, int, date, datetime, string enums, and custom schemas or lists containing any of those\n1. html/text or application/json responses containing any of the previous types\n1. Bearer token security\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can pass a YAML (or JSON) file to openapi-python-client with the `--config` option in order to change some behavior.\nThe following parameters are supported:\n\n### class_overrides\n\nUsed to change the name of generated model classes. This param should be a mapping of existing class name\n(usually a key in the "schemas" section of your OpenAPI document) to class_name and module_name. As an example, if the\nname of the a model in OpenAPI (and therefore the generated class name) was something like "\\_PrivateInternalLongName"\nand you want the generated client\'s model to be called "ShortName" in a module called "short_name" you could do this:\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nclass_overrides:\n  _PrivateInternalLongName:\n    class_name: ShortName\n    module_name: short_name\n```\n\nThe easiest way to find what needs to be overridden is probably to generate your client and go look at everything in the\nmodels folder.\n\n### project_name_override and package_name_override\n\nUsed to change the name of generated client library project/package. If the project name is changed but an override for the package name\nisn\'t provided, the package name will be converted from the project name using the standard convention (replacing `-`\'s with `_`\'s).\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nproject_name_override: my-special-project-name\npackage_name_override: my_extra_special_package_name\n```\n\n[changelog.md]: CHANGELOG.md\n[poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/\n',
