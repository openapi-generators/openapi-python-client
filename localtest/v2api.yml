        2. Then, all objects are either created or updated accordingly, temporarily
        skipping any schema field links between objects.

        3. Schema field links can be populated using entity registry IDs or API IDs.

        4. Entities are registered, using the provided name and entity registry ID.

        Upload a part of the blob. This part must be at least 5MB, unless it''s the
        last or only part. It''s recommended to keep the part size around 10MB.


        The data64 parameter is the base64-encoded part contents, and the md5 parameter
        is the hex-encoded MD5 hash of the part contents. For example, given the string
        hello, data64 is aGVsbG8= and md5 is 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592.


        ## Multipart Upload


        If a blob is larger than 10MB, it should be uploaded in multiple parts using
        the following endpoints:

        - [Start a multi-part blob upload](#/Blobs/createMultipartBlob)

        - [Upload a blob part](#/Blobs/createBlobPart)

        - [Complete a blob upload](#/Blobs/completeMultipartBlob)


        Each part has a *partNumber* and an *eTag*. The part number can be any number
        between 1 to 10,000, inclusive - this number should be unique and identifies
        the order of the part in the final blob. The eTag of a part is returned in
        the API response - this eTag must be specified when completing the upload
        in order to ensure the server has received all the expected parts.

        This operation performs the following actions:

        2. Then, all objects are either created or updated accordingly, temporarily
        skipping any schema field links between objects.

        3. Schema field links can be populated using entity registry IDs or API IDs.
        In the `value` field of the [Field](#/components/schemas/FieldWithResolution)
        resource, the object `{"entityRegistryId": ENTITY_REGISTRY_ID}` may be provided
        instead of the API ID if desired (see example value). You may link to objects
        being created in the same operation.

        4. Entities are registered, using the provided name and entity registry ID.

            take. They''re organized by "days" (which are user-configurable) and modeled
            within each day as a list of "notes." Each note has a type - the simplest
            is a "text" type, but lists, tables, and external files are also supported.


            *Note:* the current Entry resource has a few limitations:

            - Formatting information is not yet supported. Header formatting, bolding,
            and other stylistic information is not presented.

            - Data in tables is presented as text always - numeric values will need
            to be parsed into floats or integers, as appropriate.


            Note: Data in Results tables are not accessible through this API call.
            Results table data can be called through the Results API calls.

        2. Then, all objects are either created or updated accordingly, temporarily
        skipping any schema field links between objects.

        3. Schema field links can be populated using entity registry IDs or API IDs.

        4. Entities are registered, using the provided name and entity registry ID.

            - If a template table has one row, the values in that row act as default
            values for cloned entries.

            - If a template table has multiple rows, there is no default value and
            those rows are added to the cloned entry along with the provided csv data.

            - If a table has default values, they will be populated in any respective
            undefined columns in the csv data.

            - If a table has no default values, undefined columns from csv data will
            be empty.

            - If no csv data is provided for a table, the table in the entry will
            be populated with whatever values are in the respective template table.

    Boxes are a structured inventory type, consisting of a grid of positions that
    can each hold one container. Unlike locations, there are a maximum number of containers
    that a box can hold (one per position).


    Boxes are all associated with schemas, which define the type of the box (e.g.
    "10x10 Cryo Box") along with the fields that are tracked and the dimensions of
    the box.


    Like all inventory, every Box has a barcode that is unique across the registry.

    Containers are the backbone of sample management in Benchling. They represent

    Plates are a structured inventory type, grids of wells that each function like
    containers. Plates come in two types: a traditional "fixed" type, where the wells
    cannot move, and a "matrix" type. A matrix plate has similar functionality to
    a box, where the containers inside can be moved around and removed altogether.


    Plates are all associated with schemas, which define the type of the plate (e.g.
    "96 Well Plate") along with the fields that are tracked, the dimensions of the
    plate, and whether or not the plate is a matrix plate or a traditional well plate.


    Like all inventory, every Plate has a barcode that is unique across the registry.

    Endpoints that perform expensive computations launch long-running tasks. These
    endpoints return the task ID (a UUID) in the response body.


    After launching a task, periodically invoke the [Get a task](#/Tasks/getTask)
    endpoint with the task UUID (e.g., every 10 seconds), until the status is no longer
    RUNNING.


    You can access a task for up to 30 minutes after its completion, after which its
    data will no longer be available.
