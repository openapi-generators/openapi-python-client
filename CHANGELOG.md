## 0.5.0 - Unreleased
### Internal Changes
- Switched OpenAPI document parsing to use 
    [openapi-schema-pydantic](https://github.com/kuimono/openapi-schema-pydantic/pull/1) (#103)

## 0.4.2 - 2020-06-13
### Additions
- Support for responses with no content (#63 & #66). Thanks @acgray!
- Support for custom string formats (#64 & #65). Thanks @acgray!


## 0.4.1 - 2020-06-02
### Additions
- Support for Python 3.7 (#58)


## 0.4.0 - 2020-05-30
### Breaking Changes
- Classes generated to be included within lists will now be named like <ListName>Item. For example, if a property 
    named "statuses" is an array of enum values, previously the `Enum` class declared would be called "Statuses". Now it 
    will be called "StatusesItem". If a "title" attribute was used in the OpenAPI document, that should still be respected
    and used instead of the generated name. You can restore previous names by adding "StatusesItem" to the `class_overrides`
    section of a config file.
- Clients now require httpx ^0.13.0 (up from ^0.12.1). See [httpx release notes](https://github.com/encode/httpx/releases/tag/0.13.0)
    for details.

### Additions
- Support for binary format strings (file payloads)
- Support for multipart/form bodies
- Support for any supported property within a list (array), including other lists.
- Support for Union types ("anyOf" in OpenAPI document)
- Support for more basic response types (integer, number, boolean)
- Support for duplicate enums. Instead of erroring, enums with the same name (title) but differing values 
    will have a number appended to the end. So if you have two conflicting enums named `MyEnum`, one of them
    will now be named `MyEnum1`. Note that the order in which these are processed and therefore named is entirely
    dependent on the order they are read from the OpenAPI document, so changes to the document could result 
    in swapping the names of conflicting Enums.

### Changes
- The way most imports are handled was changed which *should* lead to fewer unused imports in generated files.
- Better error messages
    - Most error messages will contain some useful information about why it failed instead of a stack trace
    - Client will still be generated if there are recoverable errors, excluding endpoints that had those errors
- Output from isort and black when generating will now be suppressed

### Fixes
- Defaults within models dataclasses for `Dict` or `List` properties will now be properly declared as a 
    `field` with the `default_factory` parameter to prevent errors related to mutable defaults.
