# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## 0.4.0 - Unreleased
### Breaking Changes
- Classes generated to be included within lists will now be named like <ListName>Item. For example, if a property 
    named "statuses" is an array of enum values, previously the `Enum` class declared would be called "Statuses". Now it 
    will be called "StatusesItem". If a "title" attribute was used in the OpenAPI document, that should still be respected
    and used instead of the generated name.

### Additions
- Support for binary format strings (file payloads)
- Support for multipart/form bodies
- Support for any supported property within a list (array), including other lists.

### Changes
- The way most imports are handled was changed which *should* lead to fewer unused imports in generated files.
