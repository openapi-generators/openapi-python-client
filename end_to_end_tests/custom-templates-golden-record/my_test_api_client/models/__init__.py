# To avoid having to update this file in the golden record every time the test specs are changed,
# we won't include all the classes in this output - we'll just look for one of them.

# Using "alls"
#   AModel

# Using "imports"
#   from .a_model import AModel

# Using "openapi.models"
#   AModel (a_model)
