    The `Link object` represents a possible design-time link for a response.
    The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's ability to successfully invoke it,
    rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.

    Unlike _dynamic_ links (i.e. links provided **in** the response payload),
    the OAS linking mechanism does not require link information in the runtime response.

    For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them,
    a [runtime expression](#runtimeExpression) is used for accessing values in an operation
    and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.
