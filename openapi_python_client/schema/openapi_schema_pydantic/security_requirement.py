"""
Lists the required security schemes to execute this operation.
The name used for each property MUST correspond to a security scheme declared in the
[Security Schemes](#componentsSecuritySchemes) under the [Components Object](#componentsObject).

Security Requirement Objects that contain multiple schemes require that
all schemes MUST be satisfied for a request to be authorized.
This enables support for scenarios where multiple query parameters or HTTP headers
are required to convey security information.

When a list of Security Requirement Objects is defined on the
[OpenAPI Object](#oasObject) or [Operation Object](#operationObject),
only one of the Security Requirement Objects in the list needs to be satisfied to authorize the request.

Each name MUST correspond to a security scheme which is declared
in the [Security Schemes](#componentsSecuritySchemes) under the [Components Object](#componentsObject).
If the security scheme is of type `"oauth2"` or `"openIdConnect"`,
then the value is a list of scope names required for the execution,
and the list MAY be empty if authorization does not require a specified scope.
For other security scheme types, the array MUST be empty.
