# Ways you can Contribute

- Document bugs and missing features as issues.
- Find and document the relevant [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) for open issues.
- Create a pull request addressing an open issue.

# Contributing Code

## Setting up a Dev Environment

1. Make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed and up to date.
2. Make sure you have a supported Python version (e.g. 3.8) installed and accessible to Poetry (e.g. with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
3. Use `poetry install` in the project directory to create a virtual environment with the relevant dependencies.
4. Enter a `poetry shell` to make running commands easier.

## Writing Code

1. Write some code and make sure it's covered by unit tests. All unit tests are in the `tests` directory and the file
   structure should mirror the structure of the source code in the `openapi_python_client` directory.
2. When in a Poetry shell (`poetry shell`) run `task check` in order to run most of the same checks CI runs. This will 
    auto-reformat the code, check type annotations, run unit tests, check code coverage, and lint the code.
3. If you're writing a new feature, try to add it to the end to end test.
   1. If adding support for a new OpenAPI feature
      1. add the relevant feature to our FastAPI app in `end_to_end_tests/fastapi_app`.
      2. Regenerate the OpenAPI document with `task openapi`.
      3. Check `end_to_end_tests/openapi.json` to confirm it has the new feature you're trying to test.
   2. Regenerate the "golden record" with `task gr`. This is a client generated from the OpenAPI document used for end to end testing.
   3. Check the changes to `end_to_end_tests/golden-record` to confirm only what you intended to change did change and that the changes look correct.
4. Run the end to end tests with `task e2e`. This will generate a client against `end_to_end_tests/openapi.json` and 
    compare it with `end_to_end_tests/golden-record`. The test will fail if **anything is different**. The end to end 
    test is not included in `task check` as it takes longer to run and doesn't provide very useful feedback in the 
    event of failure. If this test does fail, the easiest way to check what's wrong is to run `task gr` and check 
    the diff of `golden-record`.
5. Include a summary of your changes in `CHANGELOG.md`. If there isn't an "Unreleased" version in the CHANGELOG yet, 
    go ahead and add one.

## Creating a Pull Request

Once you've written the code and run the checks, the next step is to create a pull request against the `main` branch of this repository. Currently @dbanty is the
only reviewer / approver of pull requests for this repo, so you should @mention him to make sure he sees it. Once your PR is created, a series of automated checks
should run. If any of them fail, try your best to fix them. Note that currently deepsource tends to find "issues" that aren't actually issues, so there might be
failures that don't have anything to do with the code you changed. If that's the case, feel free to ignore them.

## Wait for Review

As soon as possible, your PR will be reviewed. If there are any changes requested there will likely be a bit of back and forth. Once this process is done,
your changes will be merged into main and included in the next release. If you need your changes available on PyPI by a certain time, please mention it in the
PR and I'll do my best to accomodate.
