# Change default multipart array serialization

Previously, any arrays of values in a `multipart/form-data` body would be serialized as an `application/json` part.
This matches the default behavior specified by OpenAPI and supports arrays of files (`binary` format strings).

now-incorrect code when the encoding _was_ explicitly set to `application/json` for arrays of scalar values.
